## üß™ Core Components

### 1. DNASequence Class (`dna_sequence.py`)

The foundation class representing double-stranded DNA molecules with various molecular biology operations.

**Key Features:**
- **Sequence Validation**: Ensures only valid nucleotides (A, T, G, C)
- **Automatic Complementary Strand Generation**: Models Watson-Crick base pairing
- **Restriction Enzyme Simulation**: Sequence-specific cutting operations

**Main Functions:**

| Function | Purpose | Molecular Process Modeled |
|----------|---------|--------------------------|
| `__init__(sequence)` | Creates DNA molecule with complementary strand | DNA synthesis and hybridization |
| `is_valid_sequence()` | Validates nucleotide composition | Quality control in DNA synthesis |
| `_generate_complementary_strand()` | Creates Watson-Crick complement | DNA hybridization (A‚ÜîT, G‚ÜîC) |
| `cleave(enzymeRecognitionSeq)` | Cuts DNA at specific sequences | Restriction enzyme digestion |
| `isDnaSequense(strand1, strand2)` | Checks strand complementarity | Hybridization assay |

**Example Usage:**
```python
# Create DNA molecule
dna = DNASequence("ATCGGAATTCGGAATTC")

# Simulate EcoRI restriction digestion
fragments = dna.cleave("GAATTC")  # EcoRI recognition site
print(fragments)  # ['ATCG', 'G']
```

### 2. PCRSimulator Class (`PCRSimulator.py`)

Simulates Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) for exponential DNA amplification with error modeling.

**Molecular Process Modeled:** 
- DNA denaturation (strand separation)
- Primer annealing
- DNA polymerase extension
- Replication errors

**Key Functions:**

| Function | Purpose | Real PCR Step |
|----------|---------|---------------|
| `pcr_amplify(dna_sequence, num_cycles, error_rate)` | Exponential amplification | Complete PCR cycling |
| `get_complementary_base(base)` | Base pairing during synthesis | DNA polymerase activity |

**Features:**
- **Exponential Amplification**: 2^n molecules after n cycles
- **Error Modeling**: Simulates polymerase errors during synthesis
- **Cycle Tracking**: Models multiple PCR rounds

### 3. MolecularTube Class (`molecular_tube.py`)

Represents a test tube containing multiple DNA molecules, enabling molecular separation and analysis operations.

**Molecular Processes Modeled:**
- Gel electrophoresis separation
- Affinity purification
- Molecular filtering

**Key Functions:**

| Function | Purpose | Lab Technique Modeled |
|----------|---------|---------------------|
| `add(molecule)` | Add DNA to tube | Sample preparation |
| `extract(target_sequence)` | Isolate specific sequences | Affinity chromatography |
| `intersect(other_tube)` | Find common molecules | Comparative analysis |
| `is_empty()` | Check for molecules | Detection assay |

### 4. MolecularThreeSATSolver Class (`solution.py`)

Implements a molecular computing algorithm to solve the 3-SAT Boolean satisfiability problem using DNA operations.

**Computational Approach:**
- **DNA Encoding**: Each variable assignment encoded as DNA sequence
- **Parallel Processing**: All possible assignments generated simultaneously
- **Molecular Filtering**: Unsatisfying assignments removed by "molecular operations"

**Key Functions:**

| Function | Purpose | Molecular Operation |
|----------|---------|-------------------|
| `_initialize_encodings()` | Create unique DNA codes for variables | DNA synthesis |
| `_generate_initial_tube()` | Create all possible assignments | Combinatorial DNA library |
| `_process_clause()` | Filter assignments by clause satisfaction | Selective hybridization |
| `solve()` | Complete 3-SAT solving pipeline | Sequential molecular operations |

**Algorithm Steps:**
1. **Library Generation**: Create DNA molecules for all 2^n variable assignments
2. **Clause Processing**: For each clause, keep only molecules representing satisfying assignments
3. **Solution Detection**: Check if any molecules remain (satisfiable) or tube is empty (unsatisfiable)

## üöÄ Running the Lab

### Basic DNA Operations
```python
# Create and analyze DNA
from dna_sequence import DNASequence

dna = DNASequence("ATCGGAATTC")
print(dna)  # Shows double-stranded DNA
fragments = dna.cleave("GAATTC")  # Restriction digestion
```

### PCR Simulation
```python
from PCRSimulator import PCRSimulator

pcr = PCRSimulator()
amplified = pcr.pcr_amplify(dna, num_cycles=3, error_rate=0.001)
print(f"Amplified to {len(amplified)} molecules")
```

### Molecular Computing example:
```python
from solution import MolecularThreeSATSolver

# Solve 3-SAT problem: (x1 ‚à® x2 ‚à® x3) ‚àß (¬¨x1 ‚à® x2 ‚à® x3)
solver = MolecularThreeSATSolver(3)
solver.add_clause([1, 2, 3])      # (x1 ‚à® x2 ‚à® x3)
solver.add_clause([-1, 2, 3])     # (¬¨x1 ‚à® x2 ‚à® x3)
is_satisfiable = solver.solve()
```
